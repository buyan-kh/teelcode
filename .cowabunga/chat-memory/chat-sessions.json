I don't have direct access to files or their content, so I can't directly retrieve or review specific files like `select.tsx` from your project. However, I can guide you through understanding or working with a typical `select.tsx` component in a React application if you share the code or specific details about what you need help with! Whether it's about handling state, props, event handling, or styling, feel free to ask.",
